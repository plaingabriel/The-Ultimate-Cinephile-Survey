# The Ultimate Cinephile Survey

A survey was made to figure out your movie interest and pass the "Survey Form" test of the freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design certification.

Why a cinephile survey? Because I love watching movies :D

**Note:
- I want to conect the form to a database but actually I don't know how do it.
